Printing decreasing stars from n-1 back down to 1 after the peak.\n\nFurthermore, we have a function name tough() which has two arguments namely \"indentation\" and \"n\" which are explained in detail below:  \n- indentation: It controls how many spaces will be printed before each row of stars. This allows the pattern to be \"indented\" or shifted to the right.\n- n: It determines how many stars will be in the longest row (the peak of the pattern) and controls the total size of the pattern.\n\nWe have three main cases for the function:  \n1. Base case, which is stopping condition where if n=0, the function does nothing and simply returns.This avoids any further pattern generation when no stars are required\n2. Increasing case, where for loop iterates from 1 to n. Each iteration prints a line with i stars (* repeated i times).This allows each line to be indented by that many spaces.\n3. Decreasing case, where for loop prints the \"downward\" part of the pattern, starting from n-1 stars and decreasing to 1 star. Here, the loop runs from n-1 down to 1, so the third argument -1 in range(n-1, 0, -1) tells the range to count downwards.\n\nHence, using the arguments (0,4) the recursive function is demonstrated.",
